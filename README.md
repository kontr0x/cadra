# Contextual Active Directory Risk Assessment

This repository provides a tool for conducting contextual risk assessments of Active Directory environments. It is based on the NIST SP 800-30 *Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments* (Rev. 1), which inspired txOne researchers to develop a practical methodology for evaluating Active Directory risks. This tool implements a modified version of that approach.
